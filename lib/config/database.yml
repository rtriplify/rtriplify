# Objects are classified according to their type. However, you can specify
# a mapping here, if objects of a certain type should be associated with a
# different class (e.g. classify all users as 'foaf:person'). If you are
# unsure it is safe to leave this configuration array empty.

# Additional metadata
# You can add arbitrary metadata. The keys of the following array are
# properties, the values will be represented as respective property values.

metadata:
  dc:title: test
  dc:publisher: test

# Set this to true in order to register your linked data endpoint with the
# Triplify registry (http://triplify.org/Registry).
# Registering is absolutely recommended, since that allows other Web sites
# (e.g. peer Web applications, search engines and mashups) to easily find your
# content. Requires PHP ini variable allow_url_fopen set to true.
# You can also register your data source manually by accessing register.php in
# the triplify folder, or at: http://triplify.org/Registry

register: true
ttl: 0
cachedir: cache

# Linked Data Depth
#
# Specify on which URI level to expose the data - possible values are:
#  - Use 0 or ommit to expose all available content on the highest level
#    all content will be exposed when /triplify/ is accessed on your server
#    this configuration is recommended for small to medium websites.
#  - Use 1 to publish only links to the classes on the highest level and all
#    content will be exposed when for example /triplify/user/ is accessed.
#  - Use 2 to publish only links on highest and classes level and all
#    content will be exposed on the instance level, e.g. when /triplify/user/1/
#    is accessed.
#
LinkedDataDepth: 2

# Callback Functions
#
 # Some of the columns of the Triplify queries will contain data, which has to
 # be processed before exposed as RDF (literals). This configuration array maps
 # column names to respective functions, which have to take the data value as a
 # parameter and return it processed.

CallbackFunctions:


# Semantic Pingback
#
# This section contains the Semantic Pingback configuration.
#
pingback:
  # Whether X-Pingback header should be exposed and XML-RPC is active.
  enabled: true
  #Whether to write Pingbacks with the instance data.
  write: true
  #Whether to use mod_rewrite, if it is available...
